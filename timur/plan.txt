Calculation algorithm:

1) Take the first image (or use the second image from the previous iteration)
2) Get the distance from the camera to the surface of the earth
3) Get an area of 1 pixel (treat the distance as sqrt(area)?)
4) Wait n seconds (to set up later)
5) Take the second image
6) Find matching details, average out the lines connecting the matching details (Average line of match)
7) Use the distance of the line of match with the "distance" of 1 pixel to calculate the change in the distance
8) Speed = dx/n
9) Repeat 1-9 steps, keeping track of time left, print out the result when the time runs out

Note: for more accurate results all the calculation results in steps 2,3 and 8 should be averaged out with the results from the previous iterations.

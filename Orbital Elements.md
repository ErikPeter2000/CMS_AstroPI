# Orbital Elements

## The 6 Orbital Elements

![](./Images/Orbit1.svg)

1. Eccentricity: Defines the shape of an ellipse. 0 is perfect circle, 1 is a parabola.  

2. Semi-major Axis: The farthest distance from the centre of the ellipse. Also half the sum of the periapsis and apoapsis.  

3. Inclination: The vertical tilt of the ellipse to the reference plane.  

4. Ascending Node: Where the ellipse intersects upwards through the reference plane. Usually given as a longitude coordinate.

5. Argument of periapsis: The orientation of the ellipse around the orbital plane, measured from the ascending node to the periapsis.

6. True anomaly: The position of the body on the ellipse, in degrees.

## Other Terminology
1. Epoch: the position of the body at t=0.

2. Period: The time it takes for the body to complete one orbit.
3. Apoapsis/Apogee: Furthest distance from orbiting body.

4. Periapsis/Perigee: Closes distance to orbiting body.

5. Semi-major axis: Furthest distance from the centre of the ellipse.

6. Semi-minor axis: Closest distance to the centre of the orbital ellipse.

7. Mean Anomaly: A fictitious 'angle' that represents the fraction of the period passed of the body in orbit. Has no geometric representation.

8. Primary body: The massive body.

9. Secondary body: The satellite.

## Kepler's Laws
3 Laws for describing a body in orbit around a more massive body.

1. The orbit of a secondary body is an ellipse with the primary body at one of the two foci.

2. A line segment joining a secondary and primary body sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.

3. The square of a secondary body's orbital period is proportional to the cube of the length of the semi-major axis of its orbit.

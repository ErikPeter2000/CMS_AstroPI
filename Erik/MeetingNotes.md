# Meeting Notes

Collection of notes from meetings with Richard or Other Team (OT).

## Fri 2023-12-15, Richard & OT
 - Skyfield python library will provide predicted ISS data.
 - We can choose to measure the Orbital or Surface Velocity.
 - Ground Sampling Distance: Area one pixel captures.
 - Is it possible to determine position based on Magnetic Flux Density.
 - The primary observation window is the WORF window, secondary is Node window.
 - *TODO:* Research window composition to determine image distortion. Richard said he will ask.
 - *TODO:* Ask Mr Gordon to unblock Flickr or use VPNs.
 - *TODO:* Decide what to log for post-experiment analysis.

## Tue 2024-01-02
 - We work towards an MVP.
 - 2 parts: Handle I/O. Perform calculations.
 - Need to research what is needed. Set deadlines.
 - Calculation People:
   - David, Yotam, Jasper, Timur
   - Minimal Calculation.
   - Come up with a function that spits out an answer.
   - 11th January - Plan speed calculation.
   - Review to see how long coding will take.
 - Data People:
   - Erik, Sam
   - Store data. Save data.
   - Interact with sensors.
   - Will handle how raw data is process.
   - Take images, calculate matches.
   - 4th January - Understand Documentation.
   - 19th January - Taking the images.
 - Both groups document functions.
 - OpenCV to compare images.
 - *TODO:* Yotam did not receive email. Speak to teacher.

## Tue 2024-01-09
 - Received Raspberry Pi
 - *TODO:* Set up the Pi. Needs internet access and libraries installed.

## Fri 2024-01-26
 - Discussed next steps now that the program is functional.
 - Need to refine the algorithm for calculating speed.
   - Sam and Erik may need to support the Data Team, since the algorithm developed was minimal.
 - OT stated that they are aware of the deadline and their project is progressing on time.

# CMS_AstroPi
This was our python code for [AstroPi](https://astro-pi.org/) 2024, written by students at the [Cambridge Maths School](https://cms.tela.org.uk/).  
We are working on [Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab) with Richard from RaspberryPi to try and determine the speed of the ISS, whilst also gathering useful data to analyse after the mission.  
Developed in [Python 3.11.5](https://www.python.org/).

## Hardware
 - [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
 - [Raspberry Pi Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/sense-hat/)
 - [Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-high-quality-camera/)

## Additional Libraries
 - [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
 - [logzero](https://pypi.org/project/logzero/)
 - [sense_hat](https://pypi.org/project/sense-hat/)

## Results Summary
Our program calculated a speed of 9.9km/s, as opposed to the accepted 7.7km/s (29%). Unfortunately we didn't fly over any land so feature detection was poor and mostly captured clouds.
It ran on 24-04-28 22:25:09 UTC.

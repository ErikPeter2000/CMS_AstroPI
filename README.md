# CMS_AstroPi
This is our python code for [AstroPi](https://astro-pi.org/) 2024, written by students at the [Cambridge Maths School](https://cms.tela.org.uk/).  
We are working on [Mission Space Lab](https://astro-pi.org/mission-space-lab) with Richard from RaspberryPi to try and determine the speed of the ISS, whilst also gathering useful data to analyse after the mission.
